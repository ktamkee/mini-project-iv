# Mini-project IV

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Hypothesis
(fill in your hypothesis about which subset of applicants will be most likely to have their loan approved, and why. Give some examples of how you will test this hypothesis)

Applicants that are married, educated, have a credit history and are buying an urban or semiurban house are more likely to have their loan approved because married and educated individuals have a higher total income, having a credit history can provide information on whether an individual is likely to pay off their loan, and urban areas have higher growth prospective.

I will create multiple predictive models to test which one predicts the loan status with higher accuracy. Then I will examine the features to see which one has greater significance than the others.


## EDA 
(fill in what you discovered in your exploration of the dataset)



## Process
(fill in what you did during EDA, cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, deployment, testing)
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results/Demo
(fill in your model's performance, details about the API you created, and (optional) a link to an live demo)

## Challanges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time? are there any potential issues/biases with your model/use case?)
